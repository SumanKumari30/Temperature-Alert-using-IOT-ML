# Temperature-Alert-using-IOT-ML
Ever thought that you receive a Alert message on your phone when Temperature cross threshold value in Industrial plant.
Temperature Monitoring is the most important measurement parameters that is always used for monitoring and controlling in Industries.
#Things used in our project:
#Hardwares required
1)Bolt module 
2)Bread board
3)Buzzer
4)Male to female jumper wires
5)LM35 Sensor
#Softwares required
1)Twilio
2)Bolt cloud
3)Pycharm

#Hardware Setup:
step 1- Firstly We took Bread board for connections.
step 2- Just hold the LM35 sensor in a manner such that you can read LM35 written on it.
step 3- Then, you just need to identify the pins of the sensor as VCC,output and ground from your left to right.
step 4- Take male to female wire,connect the 3 pins of the LM35 to the bolt wifi module as follows:
        *VCC pin of the LM35 connects to 5V of the Bolt wifi module.
        *Ouput pin of the LM35 connects to A0(analog input pin) of the bolt wifi-module.
        *Ground pin of the LM35 connects o the ground.
        *Lastly, Take short pin of buzzer and connect it with ground and long pin with digital pin 0.
